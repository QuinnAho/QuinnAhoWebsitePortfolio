					<p><b>About Me.</b></p><br>

					<p>The rapid advancements in virtual reality (VR) technology provide a plethora of opportunities to create immersive and interactive experiences. This thesis explores the potential applications of GPT-4, a large language model developed by OpenAI, to enhance various aspects of the VR experience. By incorporating GPT-4's natural language processing capabilities, we propose novel solutions to improve natural language interactions, voice-activated commands, virtual assistants, collaborative VR experiences, virtual training and education, adaptive storytelling, and virtual world generation. </p>

						<b><u>1.1 Background</u></b><br>

						Virtual reality (VR) has come a long way since its inception, with advancements in hardware and software enabling the creation of increasingly realistic and immersive experiences. As the technology continues to evolve, researchers and developers are seeking ways to improve various aspects of the VR experience to make it more engaging and accessible for users. One of the key areas of interest is the integration of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, which have the potential to revolutionize how users interact with virtual environments and characters. 
					</p>

					<p>

						GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, is a cutting-edge language model that has demonstrated exceptional performance in various natural language tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis. Its ability to understand and generate text in a human-like manner makes it an ideal candidate for enhancing VR experiences.

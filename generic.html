                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Quinn Aho, currently a second-year student at Wayne State University in the vibrant heart of Midtown Detroit. My academic journey encompasses the intersection of computer science and digital arts, a combination that fuels my passion and drive. Determined to make the most of my university years, I'm eager to kick-start my professional journey ahead of the curve. When I'm not immersed in coding or digital design, I lead an active lifestyle. Snowboarding is my winter escape, while diving and gymnastics challenge my physical limits and discipline. Music, however, is the soul of my free time—both performing and producing it allows me to express my creativity and emotions in a unique way.
                </p>
                <h1 class="major">A Computer Science Student</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm deeply committed to my studies in computer science and digital arts, driven by a profound passion for technology. Over the past 2.5 years, I've acquired hands-on professional experience through two pivotal internships. I served as a Technology Growth Intern at GS Engineering in Houghton, MI, and further honed my skills as a VR Visualization Intern at Corvid Technologies in Mooresville, NC. These experiences were pivotal in my professional development.

                <h1 class="major">Unreal Engine & XR Development</h1>
                <p>
                    I've developed a keen interest in Unreal Engine & XR. Throughout my internships and school projects, I've cultivated a deep-rooted passion for UE development.

								<h2>Animated a Promotional Cinematic for Raytheon Technologies:</h2> 
						<ul>
							<li>Used Unreal Engine to create a promotional cinematic showcasing Raytheon’s concept weapon design.<br></li>
							<li>Utilized keyframe animation with UE4 sequencer, particle effects, scene design, post processing effects and custom materials.
							<li> Utilized UE4’s Datasmith plugin for translating CAD assets into project assets. Used Blender to decimate and prepare other assets.</li>
						</ul>

						<p><h4><i>No media due to ITAR restrictions. This is subject to change once released to public.</i></h4><br></p>

						
								<p><h2>Created a VR Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) Positioning Tool.</h2>

									<ul>
										<li>Created a virtual reality positioning tool for a Hybrid III ATD model. Utilized inverse kinematics in UE4 to quickly and intuitively position and orient limbs to aid engineers in setting up simulation geometry.<br></li>
										<li>Rigged full ATD model in Blender and matched bone location and orientation with high fidelity computational model.</li>
										<li>Developed standalone project with complete workflow for spawning ATD and positioning lower limb. Included joint rotation limits on a per-DoF basis to ensure realistic positioning.</li>
									</ul>
